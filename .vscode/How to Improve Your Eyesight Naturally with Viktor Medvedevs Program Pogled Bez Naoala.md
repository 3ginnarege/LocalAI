## What is "Pogled Bez NaoÄala"?
 
"Pogled Bez NaoÄala" is a book written by Viktor Medvedev, a former ophthalmologist who suffered from poor eyesight himself. He discovered that the conventional methods of treating eye problems, such as glasses, contact lenses, or surgery, were not only ineffective but also harmful in the long run. He decided to research alternative ways to improve his vision naturally, and he found out that the root cause of most eye disorders was the tension and strain of the eye muscles. He then developed a series of exercises and techniques that could relax and strengthen the eye muscles, and thus improve the eyesight. He tested his program on himself and his patients, and he achieved remarkable results. He decided to share his findings with the world in his book "Pogled Bez NaoÄala", which has been translated into several languages and has helped thousands of people around the world.
 
## How does "Pogled Bez NaoÄala" work?
 
"Pogled Bez NaoÄala" is based on the principles of Dr. William Bates, an American ophthalmologist who pioneered the natural vision improvement movement in the early 20th century. Dr. Bates believed that the eyes were designed to see clearly without any artificial aids, and that most eye problems were caused by mental and physical stress. He developed a series of exercises and techniques that could relax and stimulate the eye muscles, and thus restore their natural function. Some of these exercises include palming, sunning, swinging, blinking, central fixation, shifting, and memory.
 
"Pogled Bez NaoÄala" takes these exercises to a new level by incorporating modern research and innovations. The program consists of three parts: theory, practice, and prevention. In the theory part, you will learn about the anatomy and physiology of the eye, the causes and symptoms of common eye disorders, and the principles of natural vision improvement. In the practice part, you will learn how to perform the exercises correctly and effectively, how to measure your progress, and how to adjust your program according to your needs. In the prevention part, you will learn how to protect your eyes from harmful factors such as stress, pollution, computer use, artificial lighting, etc.
